This is a website that allows you to drag and drop columns and cards, similar to Trello's web interface. I have coded a clone of that website. Please experience my product in the description section!!
But please be patient, it's a free server so the first access might take a little time. Thank you for visiting!
It's still being updated with other exciting features. Stay tuned for more!
